## FAQ

The server is hosted on AWS Electric Beanstalk at http://trie-slingshot.eba-rmufyux3.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/

***How does the CLI interact with the server?***

The CLI uses python [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/), and interacts with the server's various endpoints with POST requests to perform operations.

The server does support GET requests as well, but it is recommended to use POST requests to avoid unexpected bugs.
